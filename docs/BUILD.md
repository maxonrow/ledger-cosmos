#Tendermint/Cosmos Apps for Ledger Nano S

## Get source
Apart from cloning, be sure you get all the submodules, by calling:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Dependencies

#### Ledger Nano S

This project requires ledger firmware 1.5.5

The current repository keeps track of Ledger's SDK but it is posible to override it by changing the git submodule.

#### CircleCI CLI

CircleCI allows compiling `BOLOS` firmware both in Linux and MacOS. The CLI will download a docker container ready to run.

To install, follow the instructions here:

https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#installing-the-circleci-local-cli-on-macos-and-linux-distros

#### Docker CE

CircleCI CLI should have instructed you to install Docker. Just in case, you can find instructions here too:

https://docs.docker.com/install/


#### OS Dependencies

**Ubuntu**

Install the following packages:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install build-essential git sudo wget cmake libssl-dev libgmp-dev autoconf libtool python-pip
```

**OSX**

It is recommended that you install brew and xcode. 

Additionally you will need to:

```
brew install libusb
```

#### Python Tools

To avoid pollution your host, it is recommended that you create a virtual environment. If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) (our preference), you can do something like:

```shell script
create -n ledger python=3.7
conda activate ledger
```

Then you can safely install all the python dependencies in that enviroment. Ledger firmware 1.5.5 requires ledgerblue >= 0.1.21. 

In most cases, `make deps` should be able to install everything: 

```bash
make deps
```

# Building
There are different local builds:

 - Generic C++ code and run unit tests
 - BOLOS firmware

### Generic C++ Code / Tests

This is useful when you want to make changes to libraries, run unit tests, etc. It will build all common libraries and unit tests.

**Compile**
```
cmake . && make
```
**Run unit tests**
```
export GTEST_COLOR=1 && ctest -VV
```

### BOLOS / Ledger firmware
In order to keep builds reproducible, a Makefile is provided.

The Makefile will build the firmware in a docker container and leave the binary in the correct directory.

**Build**

The following command will build the app firmware inside a container. All output will be available to the host.
```
make        # Builds both Cosmos and Tendermint apps
```

**Upload the app to the device**
The following command will upload the application to the ledger. _Warning: The application will be deleted before uploading._
```
make load_cosmos          # Loads Cosmos app       (for users)
make load_tendermint      # Loads Tendermint app   (for validators)
```

## Continuous Integration (debugging CI issues)
This will build in a docker image identical to what CircleCI uses. This provides a clean, reproducible environment. It also can be helpful to debug CI issues.

**To build in ubuntu 16.04 and run C++ unit tests**
```
circleci build
```

**To build BOLOS firmware**
```
circleci build --job build_ledger_user
circleci build --job build_ledger_val
```
